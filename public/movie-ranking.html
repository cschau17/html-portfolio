<h3> Hook </h3>

<p> Robin Williams stand out performances, especially for the 90's where he exemplifies his classic humour but also a serious side to his dramatic acting career. <br \>
For me personally, I love the Peter Pan story that brings elements of childhood desires of being a kid yet having utmost freedom

<h3> Space Jam </h3>

<p> Nostolgia mostly with sports and an all-time great athlete</p>

<hr />

<h3> Gladiator </h3>
<img src="../assets/images/Gladiator.png">
<p>I am so drawn to story that redemption and justice is portrayed</p>

<hr />

<h3> The Fugitive </h3>
<img src="../assets/images/The Fugitive.png">

<p> More redemption and action</p>

<hr />

<h3>Harry Potter series</h3>

<p> How can one choose just one? But certainly Book 3 was my favorite story, but it seems they did miss some elements that would have prooved fun to see on screen</p>
